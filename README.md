Magify: A web app for changing the green background of an image to any background you want
Magify is a web app that lets you upload an image with a green background and replace it with any background you choose. You can select a background from a gallery of images or upload your own. Magify uses the [DukeLearning] library for image processing and green screen removal. Magify is fast and easy to use. You can save your edited image to your device or share it on social media platforms.

Magify is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [DukeLearning]. It uses the [Bootstrap] framework for responsive design. Magify is hosted on [GitHub Pages] and uses [Cloudinary] for image storage and delivery.

Magify is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested in image editing and green screen removal. You can find the source code on [GitHub] and report any issues or suggestions on the [issue tracker]. You can also fork the repo and submit pull requests with your own improvements or features.
